Testing Plan 

Firstly, I am going to make a test cases for my code in every task. For the every first thing to do, I will git the file to gitlab for version control. If the code is changed in future and become messy, I can download back the version before changing. This prevent lost the original file and cannot remember the code before changing. After preparing this, when designing the programme I will first clarify what is the code meaning and what should I do inside files. Planning is important in testing. After that, I will design a test file covering all my code. The test file includes invalid data(example: index that out of range) , unexpected error(passing string to an integer), and testing input function for the test file for me to check if there is any error. After that, expected value will be test , by comparing the  expected output value and the output value given by the input, see if the output is correct and expected. Lastly, after finding the error, I can repair and debug that. 

Secondly, I am going to write the simplest testing file. By writing the code on another file, check if there is some careless mistake such as missing characters or quotations in function. Also, if the original programming code is too difficult, I will separate the code into simpler way and just test that specific function to prevent too much error occur at same time. Also, if too much function in one file, this might confuse me on fixing all the code in one time. Separating the code will be easier for me to fix the code one by one. Moreover, simpler the code can make it easier to improve the code.
