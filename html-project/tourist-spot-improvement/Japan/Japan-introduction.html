                <h2>Japan History</h2>
                <p>Japan was long thought to have no Paleolithic occupation, but since World War II thousands of sites have been discovered across the country, resulting in a wide variety of Paleolithic devices. They combine a center unit, made by cutting without a stone surface, and a chip unit, made by using droplets of stone detached from a larger piece of stone. Migration of people using these implementations from mainland Asia to Japan is a small problem. In one arrangement, an association that arrived through what is now the Korea and Tsushima Straits enabled immigration from the Korean Cape, while another association, through what is now Soya and the Tsugaru Straits, allowed individuals to enter from Northeast Asia.</p>

                <h2>place recommend to visit</h2>
                <p>The best way to see Japan is to take this tour. I'll point out some of the cities you'll visit.</p>
                <div class="table">
                    <div style="background-image: url(Photo/pexels-yuri-yuhara-4151484.jpg)" class="thumbnail" alt = "Tokyo"></div>
                    <h4>Tokyo</h4>
                    <p>The capital, Tokyo, is an ultra-modern metropolis that is the capital of Japan, vibrant, bustling and glowing with neon lights. You might think Tokyo is the obvious choice for anyone visiting Japan, and it is. When it comes to Japan, many people first think of Tokyo, which is a special place not to be missed.</p>
                <div class="table">
                </div>
                    <div style="background-image: url(Photo/pexels-belle-co-402028.jpg)" class="thumbnail" alt = "Kyoto Kiyomizu Temple"></div>
                    <h4>Kyoto Kiyomizu Temple</h4>
                </div>
                    <p>Kyoto, one of the biggest tourist destinations in Japan, is not only suitable for overseas tourists, but also for Japanese! Kyoto seemed like an obvious choice. Kyoto was Japan's capital before Tokyo and remains the country's cultural center. Kyoto has 17 World Heritage Sites, 1,600 Buddhist temples and about 400 shrines. Every inch of Kyoto's history and about oozing. Highlights include staying in a machiya, exploring the Golden Pavilion, Kiyomizu Temple, Kyoto Imperial Palace, and Arashiyama Bamboo Forest.</p>

                <h2>Japanese Culture</h2>
                <h3>Japanese Family Traditions and Rites of Passage</h3>
                <p>Two major religions influence Japanese traditions and culture: Shintoism and Buddhism. Shintoism has been practiced in Japan for over 2,000 years. Simply said, Shintoism is the belief in kami (gods). Because Shintoism has a lot to do with rituals, some Japanese may not feel it is a religion at all, but rather a way to celebrate many of Japan's social traditions. For this reason, Buddhism can be practiced right alongside Shinto customs.</p></p>
                <h3>Living in Japan</h3>
                <p>Due to the threat of earthquakes and being surrounded by ocean, residents of Japan must be wary of earthquake and tsunami warnings. The last major tsunami triggered by an earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011, killing nearly 20,000 people in northern Japan. Even in the face of the threat of natural disasters, life in Japan today is often considered safe, orderly and friendly. Cities and larger towns have a variety of shopping options and delicious food. In addition, Japan's transportation system is considered to be one of the cleanest in the world.</p>

                <h3>The Obon Festival: a Festival of Japanese Culture</h3>
                <p>The Obon festival is a way the Japanese honor their ancestors. This three-day summer festival has been celebrated for more than 500 years and takes place in July or August.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The tradition of Oben Festival encourages people back to their ancestral place. For the respect to ancestors, people visit and clean their graves of their ancestors. There are gifts to them also such as flowers, food and wine. These are often left on the tombstons for respecting the spirits of ancestors. </p>
