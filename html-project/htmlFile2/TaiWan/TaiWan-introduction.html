                <h2>Taiwan History</h2>
                <p>In 1895, during the Japanese rule of Taiwan, Taiwanese culture began to shift from native to contemporary global culture due to its location on East Asian trade routes. Taiwan's elites learned Japanese culture and language without interfering with their religion in an effort to Japaneseize the island nation. Under the influence of American culture, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) realigned Taiwan from Japanese imperialism to Chinese nationalism.</p>
